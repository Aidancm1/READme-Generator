# README generator
  My name is Aidan and I never want to write a README from scratch,  

  The title of this project is README generator,  

  My motivation for this project was and I never want to write a README from scratch,  

  I wanted to build this project because To spend more time on code than writing a new README,  

  This project solves the problem of writing a README from scratch for every project,  

  In the process of building this project I learned a better understanding of NODE and javascript switch statements,  
  
  This project includes a mit license.
